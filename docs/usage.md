## Simulate Sensor Data

The first step is to simulate the sensor data for the bridge structure.

### Command

```bash
python src/data_simulation.py
```

### Description

This script generates simulated sensor data, including vibration, stress, and temperature values for multiple sensors placed on a bridge. The simulated data is saved to `data/raw/simulated_sensor_data.csv`.

## Preprocess the Sensor Data

Next, preprocess the sensor data to prepare it for model training.

### Command

```bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py
```

### Description

This script preprocesses the sensor data by filling missing values, normalizing the data, and saving the preprocessed data to `data/processed/preprocessed_sensor_data.csv`.

## Train the Anomaly Detection Model

Train a machine learning model to detect anomalies in the sensor data.

### Command

```bash
python src/model_training.py
```

### Description

This script trains an Isolation Forest model using the preprocessed sensor data. The trained model is saved to `models/anomaly_detection_model.pkl`.

## Detect Anomalies

Use the trained model to detect anomalies in the sensor data.

### Command

```bash
python src/anomaly_detection.py
```

### Description

This script uses the trained anomaly detection model to predict anomalies in the sensor data. The results, including anomaly labels, are saved to `outputs/reports/anomaly_detection_results.csv`.

## Visualize the Anomalies

Visualize the detected anomalies and the deformation of the bridge.

### Command

```bash
python src/visualization.py
```

### Description

This script creates a 3D animation showing the bending and deformation of the bridge based on the stress data. The animation is saved as a GIF to `outputs/figures/bridge_bending_animation.gif`.

## Example Visualization

Here is an example of the visualization generated by the project:

![Bridge Bending Animation](outputs/figures/bridge_bending_animation.gif)

## Additional Information

- Ensure that the directories specified in the commands exist.
- The visualization script requires a functioning display or a virtual display setup if running on a server.
- If you encounter any issues, refer to the [README.md](README.md) and [setup.md](setup.md) files for more details.
